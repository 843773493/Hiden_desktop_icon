Function
1. Hiden desktop icon and taskbar of windows  (after not moving the mouse or keyboard for a while )
2. keep the screen on   (while hiding)

Addition
This is what I came up with when I was using the wallpaper engine so that when I set up my computer I could see the full wallpaper instead of a bunch of ICONS. ╮(╯▽╰)╭
