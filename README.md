Function
1. Hiden desktop icon and taskbar and cursor of windows  (after not moving the mouse or keyboard for a while )

Addition

This is what I came up with when I was using the wallpaper engine so that when I set up my computer I could see the full wallpaper instead of a bunch of ICONS. ╮(╯▽╰)╭ 
Thanks to newbing, who has improved my efficiency a lot.
